# Shablol World — Desktop Player

A small desktop app that runs **only the Shablol game** (Shablol World) in its own window, with Flash support so the game works without modern browser limits.

**This program is intended only for playing Shablol.** It is not a general-purpose browser or launcher for other sites or games.
